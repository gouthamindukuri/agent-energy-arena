"""Deterministic 24-hour projection of the next day's supply vs demand.

`preview_next_day(world)` is a pure read-model over the current world
state: it never mutates state and never consumes any RNG, so the UI
can poll it on every `/state` tick. The projection runs the same
`world.hourly_tick.hourly_tick` that `World.step` runs each hour, except
weather is held at the natural deterministic baseline (current
`cloud_factor`, seasonal wind `v_mean`) — the same truth-without-noise
that `world.forecast._project_truth` uses. The balance-state chain feeds
back into DR-on-injection (`prev_balance`) and into ramp limits
(`prev_plant_outputs`) so the 24-element trace matches what a quiet
`/step` would produce given the same tile/well/refinery setpoints.

Sharing `hourly_tick` with `World._advance_one_day` is load-bearing:
any change to the hour's dispatch math (well power coupling, peaker
filtering, battery netting, solar derate, ...) lands in both sim and
preview at once. Before the seam existed, this module duplicated the
hourly loop and drifted whenever a new dispatch input was added.
